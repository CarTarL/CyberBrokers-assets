# CyberBrokers Asset Repository

CyberBrokers (CB) is a completely on-chain NFT project.  That means all the metadata, the SVG layers that create the NFTs, and the render function to create each individual NFT SVG image are all accessible through the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.   They will be accessible as long as the Ethereum blockchain exists.

This is an **unofficial** repository of assets (images + data) for CyberBrokers. While you can get the source assets from the CB contract directly, this repository was created to make it easier to grab everything at once and provide additional image formats and versions for community use.

## Reminder
The intellectual property rights for these assets beling to CyberBrokers and the individual NFT owners.   

These assets should not be used for commercial purposes without permission from CyberBrokers or the NFT owners.

## Repository
- nfts - the image files for all 10,001 NFTs in various formats
- layers - the individual unique SVG layers that are used to create the NFTs
- data - CSV files of the metadata + information to tie all of these layers/images together
- backgrounds - the SVG layers that are specifically backgrounds for the NFTs
- icons - the SVG layers that are icons for each of the Talents
- notes - documentation about the collection as a whole and any unique attributes

Enjoy !
