# CyberBrokers Asset Repository

CyberBrokers (CB) is a completely on-chain NFT project.  That means all the metadata, the SVG layers that create the NFTs, and the render function to create each individual NFT SVG image are all accessible through the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.   They will be accessible as long as the Ethereum blockchain exists.

This is an **unofficial** repository of assets (images + data) for CyberBrokers. While you can get the source assets from the CB contract directly, this repository was created to make it easier to grab everything at once and provide additional image formats and versions for community use.

Enjoy !
