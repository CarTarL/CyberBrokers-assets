# CyberBrokers-assets

This is an unofficial repository of assets (images + data) for CyberBrokers [website](https://www.cyberbrokers.io) [twitter](https://twitter.com/CyberBrokers_) [discord](https://discord.gg/josie).  All of this can be found on-chain, or cached images on IPFS.  A single place to grab all assets can be useful though.

This repository is split the following sections.

- nfts - the image files for all 10,001 NFTs in various formats
- layers - the individual unique SVG layers that are used to create the NFTs
- data - CSV files of the metadata + information to tie all of these layers/images together
- backgrounds - the SVG layers that are specifically backgrounds for the NFTs
- icons - the SVG layers that are icons for each of the Talents
- notes - documentation about the collection as a whole and any unique attributes

Enjoy !
