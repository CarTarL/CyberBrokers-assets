# Zip Files

This folder contains Zip files of all 10,001 NFTs of a given format in a single file for easy downloading.

If you are looking for a single NFT in a specific format, go back up one directory and look in the corresponding folder.

**If possible, please do not download the PNG Zip files - only download the SVG Zip files**

To get all NFTs in PNG/JPG format, you can download the corresponding SVG Zip file, then convert them all to PNG/JPEG format locally. This will save this account from a lot of bandwith usage and will be much appreciated.

Not all tools do a good job of converting SVG to PNG, JPG, or any raster format.  I recommend the following tools for converting the SVG NFTs into other formats like PNG or JPEG.  You can also use these tools to increase/descrease resolution at the SVG level and then convert to image formats, keeping the best resolution possible. 
- Windows - [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) has a user interface you can use to pull apart layers and a command line utility to convert multiple files at a single time.
- Linux: [rsvg-convert](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/LibRsvg?action=show&redirect=LibRsvg) is part of the librsvg package available on most linux varients and can be installed with apt or yum.  It is a command line utility with lots of options as well.
