# CyberBrokers Icons

For each Talent there is an associated icon in the layers.  This secction contains those icons in various formats.

## svg-unbound
- These are the exact SVG files from the layers/svg-unbound directory, renamed with the associated talent.  
- They are not of consistent size though and are not ideal for icons.

## svg-base
- A consistent set of SVG images useful for icons
- all are the same size - 100px height x 134px width
- all icons are centered within that space
- 

The following style changed were made to the svg-unbound icons
- eyes added to demon
- hour/minute hands added to holo
- one dot added to lower left die for gambler
- size of yieldfarmer reduced to better match size of other icons
