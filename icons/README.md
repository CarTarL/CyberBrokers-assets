# CyberBrokers Icons

For each Talent there is an associated icon in the layers.  This section contains those icons in various formats.

## Source Icons
- svg-unbound
- These are the exact unmodified SVG files from the layers/svg-unbound directory, renamed with the associated talent.  
- They are not of consistent size though and are not ideal for icons.

## Consistent (Base) Icons
- svg-base
- A consistent set of SVG images useful for icons
- all are the same size - 100px height x 134px width
- all icons are centered within that space
- opacity has been changed to 100%, making the icons of color black

The following style changed were made to the svg-unbound icons
- eyes added to demon
- hour/minute hands added to holo
- one dot added to lower left die for gambler
- size of yieldfarmer reduced to better match size of other icons

## Consistent Color Icons
- svg-color
- I colored or added color fill to various icons to create a more visually appealing set of icons

## PNG versions
The Base and Color icons were converted to PNG format for easy use in the following formats
- small - 100px height x 134px width
- large - 670px height x 500px width

## Zip files
If you need to download all icons of a given format at once, they are Zip files in the zip directory.

No restriction on downloading these zip files as they are not large.
